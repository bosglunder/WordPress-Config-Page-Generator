An easy way to generate a WordPress config page using code.

== Description ==

This pluging is going to be used for other projects I will be doing. The idea is to create config pages with an array.
This array can be stored inside wp_options.

*   One reader that generates the config page by reading from wp_options.
*   One writer that stores and modifies the config pages.

== Installation ==

1. Clone it into `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Run `npm run install`.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
